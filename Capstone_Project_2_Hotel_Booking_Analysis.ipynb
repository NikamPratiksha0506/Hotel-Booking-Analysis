The analysis employed methods like info(), head(), and columns() to understand the datasetâ€™s structure. Univariate and bivariate analyses revealed insights such as higher cancellation rates for bookings made well in advance and peak bookings during holidays. Through an analysis of booking trends, customer demographics, and financial data, this project aims to identify patterns and factors that affect bookings, cancellations, and revenue generation, providing actionable insights for improving operational strategies.\n",
        "In the EDA process, we began with univariate analysis to examine individual variables and understand the basic characteristics of the data. For example, analyzing the lead time showed that a significant number of bookings were made well in advance, indicating certain groups of customers preferred planning their stays months ahead.Bivariate analysis provided deeper insights by allowing us to explore relationships between two variables, such as the link between booking status (canceled or not) and lead time. It was found that bookings with long lead times tended to have a higher cancellation rate, possibly due to changes in customer plans or competitive pricing from other providers closer to the booking date.\n",
