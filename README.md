# Hotel-Booking-Analysis

## Project Overview
In the highly competitive hotel industry, maximizing occupancy and reducing cancellations are critical to profitability and customer satisfaction. This project focuses on conducting an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on hotel booking data to uncover insights that can guide effective decision-making for both city and resort hotels.

Through an analysis of booking trends, customer demographics, and financial data, this project aims to identify patterns and factors that affect bookings, cancellations, and revenue generation. The insights derived from this analysis can help hotels optimize pricing strategies, improve customer retention, and enhance overall operational efficiency.

## Data Manipulation Workflow
The data manipulation workflow for this project is divided into three key categories:

1. **Data Collection:** Loading the dataset and examining its structure using methods like `info()`, `head()`, and `columns()`.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data entries to ensure consistency and accuracy.
3. **Data Manipulation:** Performing feature engineering, aggregations, and transformations to prepare data for analysis.

## Analysis Techniques
The EDA process consists of two major types of analysis:

### 1. Univariate Analysis
- Examines individual variables to understand their distribution and characteristics.
- Example: Analyzing **lead time** revealed that a significant number of bookings were made well in advance, indicating that certain customer groups preferred to plan their stays months ahead.

### 2. Bivariate Analysis
- Explores relationships between two variables to uncover trends and correlations.
- Example: Analyzing **booking status (canceled or not) vs. lead time** showed that bookings with long lead times tended to have a higher cancellation rate. This could be due to changes in customer plans or competitive pricing from other providers closer to the booking date.

## Key Findings
- Higher cancellation rates for bookings made well in advance.
- Peak bookings occur during holiday seasons.
- Long lead times are associated with increased chances of cancellations.
- City hotels tend to have higher demand fluctuations compared to resort hotels.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Google Colab**
- **Data Visualization Libraries**


## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models to predict cancellations.
- Conduct sentiment analysis on customer reviews.
- Build an interactive dashboard for real-time insights.
